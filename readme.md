**SITE UPDATE 1 (12/10/22)**\
We're currently working on profile pages for our members, which should go live by either the end of the day or early on Monday. These pages will give you more information about our members, and which projects they're involved in

**SITE UPDATE 2 (12/26/22)**\
It has certainly been a minute! We had some minor issues along the way, but we're happy to announce that our profile page template will go live tomorrow morning! We'd love to get your feedback and suggestions on the design!\

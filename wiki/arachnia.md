This wiki is about Arachnia, the third game in the ***Arachnid Series***. If you meant to open a different wiki, please return to home.

### What's Arachnia?
Arachnia is a simple 2D platforming game. Jump from platform to platform, avoid red platforms and the void, discover the secrets of the Arachnid universe, and make it to the exit.

### Settings
Through the Advanced Settings menu option, you can fine-tune the game's settings, such as graphics. Most are self-explanatory, but we'll still provide a list of their functions:
- Fancy Graphics: controls weather high-quality graphics that might affect performance are allowed
- Particles: controls weather Arachnia will render particle effects. **Note: this does NOT disable particle generation, it only disables rendering**
- Transitions: controls weather dialogues fade in and out. This also controls weather other types of transitions are allowed
- Menu Transitions: controls weather menu features are animated or not
- Transparency Effects: controls weather menus can be rendered as partially transparent or not
- Particle Trails: controls weather the player generates a trail of particles. **Note: changing the Particles setting will NOT affect this setting!**

- Save Progress: controls weather the game will save progress. When disabled, new data will not be written to the save file. **This setting is not preserved across reloads!**
